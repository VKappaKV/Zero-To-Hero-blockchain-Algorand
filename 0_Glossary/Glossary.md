- **Fork**: A change in the blockchain protocol. A "hard fork" creates a new chain that is not compatible with the old one, while a "soft fork" is backward-compatible.
- **Full Node**: A participant in the blockchain network that keeps a full copy of the blockchain's history and validates transactions.

## G

- **Genesis Block**: The first block in a blockchain, from which all subsequent blocks follow.

## H

- **Hash**: A function that takes an input and generates a fixed-length output (a hash). In blockchain, hashes are used to secure transaction data.
- **Hash Rate**: The number of hashes (cryptographic computations) a miner can process per second. It is often used to measure the performance and security of a Proof-of-Work blockchain.

## I

- **ICO (Initial Coin Offering)**: A fundraising mechanism where new cryptocurrency projects sell tokens to investors, similar to an IPO in the stock market.
- **Interoperability**: The ability of different blockchain networks to communicate and share information with each other.

## L

- **Layer 1**: The base protocol of a blockchain (like Bitcoin or Ethereum), responsible for security, consensus, and transaction processing.
- **Layer 2**: A secondary framework built on top of a Layer 1 blockchain to increase efficiency and scalability, often through off-chain solutions like payment channels.
- **Ledger**: A record-keeping system for transactions. In blockchain, the ledger is distributed and immutable.
- **Liquidity**: The ease with which an asset can be converted into cash or another asset without affecting its price. In DeFi, liquidity pools are often used to ensure sufficient liquidity.

## M

- **Mempool**: waiting data structure where transactions are stored before being included in a block for consensus.
- **Merkle Tree**: A data structure used in blockchain to efficiently and securely verify the integrity of large sets of data by storing them in a hierarchical, hash-based structure.
- **Mining**: The process of validating blockchain transactions and adding them to the blockchain by solving cryptographic puzzles (typically in Proof of Work systems).
- **Multi-Signature (Multisig)**: A type of digital signature that requires multiple keys (usually from different parties) to authorize a transaction.

## N

- **Node**: A computer or device that participates in the blockchain network by validating transactions and maintaining a copy of the blockchain.
- **Nonce**: A number used once in cryptographic communications, commonly in mining, where miners adjust the nonce to find a valid hash for the next block.
- **NFT (Non-Fungible Token)**: A type of cryptographic token that represents a unique asset. NFTs are not interchangeable and often represent digital art, collectibles, or virtual real estate.

## O

- **Oracles**: Third-party services that provide external data to smart contracts, allowing them to interact with real-world events (e.g., price feeds, weather data).

## P

- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)**: A decentralized interaction where two parties directly transact with each other without intermediaries.
- **Private Key**: A secret key used to access and control cryptocurrency in a wallet. It must be kept secure, as anyone with access to the private key can control the funds.
- **Proof of Work (PoW)**: A consensus mechanism where participants (miners) solve computationally intensive puzzles to validate transactions and secure the blockchain.
- **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: A consensus mechanism where participants (validators) validate transactions based on the number of tokens they hold (staked) in the network.

- **Sharding**: A method for increasing the scalability of blockchain networks by splitting the network into smaller parts (shards) that process transactions in parallel.
